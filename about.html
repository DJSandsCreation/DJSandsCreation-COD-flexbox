          and published by Activision. Activision Blizzard announced Modern Warfare 2 on February 11,

          game and featuring several returning characters including Captain Price and "Soap" MacTavish</p>
        <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</h3>
        <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a first-person shooter video game. It is the eighth installment of the Call
          of Duty series and the third installment of the Modern Warfare arc. Due to a legal dispute between the game's
          publisher Activision and the former co-executives of Infinity Ward – which caused several lay-offs and
          departures within the company – Sledgehammer Games assisted in the development of the game, while Raven
          Software was brought in to make cosmetic changes to the menus of the game. The game was said to have been
          in development since only two weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Sledgehammer was
          aiming for a "bug free" first outing in the Call of Duty franchise, and had also set a goal for Metacritic
          review scores above 95 percent.

          The game continues the story from the point at which it ended in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and
          continues the fictional battle story between the United States and Russia, which evolves into the Third World
          War between NATO allied nations and ultra-nationalist Russia.</p>
        <h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</h3>
        <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is the sixteenth entry in the Call of Duty series and is also a reboot of the
          Modern Warfare series. The story has been described to be darker and realistic than previous Call of Duty
          games. It is set in a separate timeline from the other Modern Warfare games (however, characters such as
          Captain Price and other fan favorites from the series make a return). The game was officially revealed on May
          30, 2019, and released on October 25, 2019.

          The second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, titled Call of Duty: Warzone, was
          released in March 2020, as a part of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare video game but does not require purchase
